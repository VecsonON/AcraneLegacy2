Magecraft is the lost art of manipulating reality at will. Magecraft was completely forgotten and is now considered a legend. Magecraft involved manipulating the inner arcana to control the arcana in the air and using the combined inner and outer arcana to alter reality. The main means of altering reality was by using the Arcana as fuel to exploit physical laws, called spells. The next method is to use the Arcana to rewrite reality bypassing the constraints of physical laws, which is called the Rewriting Spell. The last method was to use special circles carved in the raw material and push the arcana through them in a manner resembling a spell. This created a ritual that could be explained as constant use of the spell

The player can decide at the beginning of the game whether he will be an ordinary person looking for magecraft, an ordinary person with no aspirations to find magecraft, or a young magician who accidentally stumbled upon a mage tower and thus became a mage.
